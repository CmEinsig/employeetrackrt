# employeeTracker
An employee tracker within the SQL database 

## Description
My motivation for this project was to test my new skills in MySQL. I built this project to create a database for employee tracker. This solved the problem of having a centralized location for employee information.  I learned that MySQL is very repetative and a lot of copy and editing the first bit of code was needed.
